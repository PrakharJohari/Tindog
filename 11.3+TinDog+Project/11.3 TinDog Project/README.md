# Tindog - Tinder for Dogs 🐾

Tindog is a playful, frontend-only web application inspired by the concept of Tinder but designed for dog owners to connect their pets with potential playmates. This project was built using HTML, CSS, and Bootstrap to create a visually appealing, responsive landing page that showcases the idea and functionality of the app.

## Project Overview 📖
This app simulates a matchmaking platform where dog owners can find nearby dogs for playdates, meet-ups, and companionship. While this version is currently non-functional and only includes the frontend, it gives a realistic view of how the app interface would look, with sections like features, download buttons, and an engaging hero banner.

## Features 🎉
- **Responsive Design**: Optimized for various screen sizes using Bootstrap.
- **Landing Page**: Includes an interactive hero section, feature highlights, and a download prompt for users.
- **Modular Sections**: Clear separation of content areas for easy customization and enhancement.

## Tech Stack 💻

- **CSS3**: For styling and custom design elements.
- **Bootstrap 4**: For responsive design, layout, and built-in components.
